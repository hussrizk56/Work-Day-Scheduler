# Work-Day-Scheduler

For this week's assignment we were to create a website for a simple work day calendar by hour. The application used HTML, CSS, JS powered by jQuery. You can block off time for your calendar for items to do. Time that has passed is in grey, current hour is blocked in red, and future is green. 


## Steps Taken:
* Used moment js library to function the schedule.
* Used CSS, HTML, and JS powered by jQuery to support the function of the entire work scheduler. 
* Used function to allow to show a live time that will be shown at the top of the scheduler.
* The user is able to add items to the schedule using event listener and local storage. 
* Styled using "if/else" function with different colors.
